# Multi-task learning of functional connectivity on the ABIDE dataset

### purposes of the project
- to analyze brain connectivity using GGM models
- to reduce the dimension and consequently the computation complexity of brain networks

### includes code from
- SIMULE: https://github.com/UVA-MachineLearningBioinformatics/Papers-sGGM
- Direct Learning of Sparse Changes: http://www.ism.ac.jp/~liu/SCD.html
